# Aria Client SDK For Python

The Aria Client SDK with CLI provides robust capabilities for creating computer vision
and machine learning applications with Project Aria glasses.

## Luna's Edits

I've created the main.py python script and extract_images.py. Main.py processes the vrs files that I've collected through Aria glasses on subjects which extract_images retrieves the rgb frames from the processed files.
